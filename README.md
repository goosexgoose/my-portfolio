# Personal Portfolio Platform

A full-featured, self-hosted portfolio platform built with **Next.js**, **Firebase**, **TipTap**, and **Tailwind CSS**. This project is more than a personal website ‚Äî it‚Äôs a content management platform that allows full control over the display, editing, and publishing of diverse project types, including code, game localization, and photography.

## ‚ú® Features

### üåê Public-Facing Pages
- `/projects`: Displays all published projects, grouped by category, with filters, hover animations, and skill tags.
- `/projects/[id]`: Detail pages rendered from TipTap JSON content, supporting images, YouTube videos, and multilingual layout.
- `/cv`: Timeline-based resume with animation, downloadable PDF resume (multi-language), and a project carousel.
- `/gallery`: Login-gated gallery with hover effects and image viewer/lightbox.
- `/contact`: Contact form connected to Firestore and/or EmailJS (optional notifications).

### üîê Admin Dashboard (`/admin`)
- **Authentication**: Firebase Auth with Google login support.
- **Project Manager**: 
  - Rich text editor (TipTap) with auto-save
  - Upload images, YouTube videos, PDFs

  - Timestamps (`createdAt`, `updatedAt`)
- **Gallery Manager**: Manage and upload private photos.
- **CV Manager**: Edit CV timeline and upload resumes (multi-language).
